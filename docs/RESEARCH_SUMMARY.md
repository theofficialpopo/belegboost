---

## Research Areas Covered

### 1. Multi-Tenant SaaS Applications ✅

**Status:** Comprehensive patterns identified
**Confidence Level:** High
**Production Examples:** Multiple (Vercel Platforms, AWS SaaS, Azure Multi-Tenancy)

#### Key Findings

**Subdomain Routing Strategy (Recommended):**
- Industry standard for B2B SaaS (Vercel, AWS, Microsoft)
- Better security isolation than path-based routing
- Professional appearance for each tenant
- Wildcard DNS configuration required
- Amazon CloudFront added native support in May 2025

**Tenant Isolation Models:**
1. **Silo** (Database per tenant) - Highest isolation, highest cost
2. **Bridge** (Schema per tenant) - Medium isolation, medium complexity
3. **Pool** (Shared schema + tenant_id) - **RECOMMENDED** for BelegBoost

**Critical Security Pattern:**
- ALWAYS filter database queries by `tenant_id`
- Use Data Access Layer (DAL) to centralize enforcement
- Add `tenant_id` to JWT claims for request context
- Write comprehensive E2E tests for tenant isolation

### 2. Next.js 15 Middleware ✅

**Status:** Production-ready patterns available
**Confidence Level:** High
**Official Reference:** Vercel Platforms Starter Kit

#### Key Findings

**Middleware Best Practices (2025):**
- File location: `middleware.ts` at project root
- Runs on Edge Runtime by default (Node.js runtime available since v15.5)
- Use for routing/redirection, NOT sole authentication mechanism
- Critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-29927): Always verify auth in route handlers too

**Subdomain Detection Pattern:**
```typescript
// Extract subdomain from host header
const hostname = request.headers.get('host') || '';
const subdomain = extractSubdomain(hostname);

// Rewrite to tenant-specific path
url.pathname = `/tenants/${subdomain}${url.pathname}`;
return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
```

**Environment Handling:**
- **Localhost:** `tenant.localhost:3000`
- **Production:** `tenant.belegboost.de`
- **Vercel Preview:** Special handling for preview URLs

**Production Example:**
- Repository: https://github.com/vercel/platforms
- Direct middleware: https://github.com/vercel/platforms/blob/main/middleware.ts
- Used by thousands of production apps

**Sources:**
- Official Docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware

### 3. Appwrite Multi-Tenancy ✅

**Status:** Official pattern documented
**Confidence Level:** High
**Official Support:** Dedicated documentation page

#### Key Findings

**Appwrite Teams = Tenants:**
- Create one Team per tenant (tax advisor firm)
- Team ID stored as `tenant_id` in database
- Built-in permission system based on team membership
- Roles: `owner`, `advisor`, `client` (customizable)

**Permission Levels:**
1. **Table Level:** Applies to all rows in collection
2. **Row Level:** Applies to individual documents (requires Row Security enabled)

**Critical Pattern:**
```typescript
// Always include tenant_id in documents
await databases.createDocument(
  'db',
  'collection',
  'unique()',
  {
    ...data,
    tenant_id: tenantId  // CRITICAL
  },
  [
    Permission.read(Role.team(teamId)),
    Permission.update(Role.team(teamId, 'owner'))
  ]
);
```

**Storage Organization:**
- **Option 1:** Single bucket with folder structure
- **Option 2:** Bucket per tenant (RECOMMENDED for better isolation)
- Bucket-level permissions available
- File-level permissions optional

**Limitations Noted:**
- Community requests for better Team API features
- Need to manually filter queries by `tenant_id` (permissions are additional layer)
- No built-in cross-team analytics queries

**Sources:**
- Official Guide: https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/multi-tenancy
- Teams API: https://appwrite.io/docs/server/teams
- Permissions: https://appwrite.io/docs/products/databases/permissions

### 4. GDPR Compliance (Germany) ✅

**Status:** Legal requirements identified
**Confidence Level:** High (requires legal review)
**Complexity:** High (financial data + German jurisdiction)

#### Key Findings

**Legal Framework:**
- **GDPR:** EU-wide regulation (directly applicable)
- **BDSG:** German Federal Data Protection Act (supplements GDPR)
- **TTDSG:** German Telecommunications-Telemedia Data Protection Act (cookies)

**Critical Requirements:**

**1. Data Protection Officer (DPO):**
- GDPR: Required for systematic monitoring or large-scale sensitive data
- BDSG §38: Required if ≥20 persons process personal data (STRICTER than GDPR)
- **For BelegBoost:** Likely required once team has 20+ people

**2. Audit Logging (Article 5(2) - Accountability):**
- Logs must be **immutable** (append-only)
- Store for minimum 3 years (industry standard)
- Log: authentication, data access, exports, deletions, config changes
- Pseudonymize user identifiers where possible

**3. Required Legal Pages:**
- **Impressum** (Imprint) - TMG §5 - Company details, legal form, registration
- **Datenschutzerklärung** (Privacy Policy) - Must be in German
- **Cookie Consent** - TTDSG - Must get consent BEFORE setting cookies

**4. Data Subject Rights:**
- Right to access (Article 15) - Export data as JSON/ZIP
- Right to rectification (Article 16) - Update profile
- Right to erasure (Article 17) - Delete account (with retention exceptions)
- Right to data portability (Article 20) - Machine-readable format

**5. Balancing Retention vs. Erasure:**
- Tax documents: 10 years retention (German tax law) - overrides erasure
- Audit logs: 3 years (legitimate interest for security)
- Personal data: Delete on request (unless legal basis for retention)
- Solution: Pseudonymize audit logs, delete personal data

**6. Hosting Location:**
- Must host in Germany or EU for financial data
- Self-hosting on Hetzner Germany recommended
- Avoids US data transfer complications

**Penalties:**
- Up to €20M or 4% annual global turnover (whichever is higher)
